description: End-to-end release workflow for publishing a Node/TypeScript package to npm — commits pending changes, pushes, bumps version, runs prepublish lint and dry-run checks, publishes (handling scoped names and 2FA), then pushes tags. Use this skill whenever the user asks to "publish", "release", "ship", "push to npm", "publish to npmjs", "cut a release", "tag a version", or any combination of "commit + push + publish". Trigger even when the user only mentions one stage (e.g. "just publish it") — the skill decides which stages to skip based on repo state. Also trigger when the user is about to run `npm publish` for the first time and would benefit from pre-flight checks.

# npm-release

End-to-end "ship a package to npm" workflow. The default scope is the full chain — commit pending work → push → version bump → publish → push tag — but every stage is skippable based on repo state. The point is to **catch the boring footguns before they hit the registry**, because every published version number is permanent (you cannot reuse `1.2.3` even after `npm unpublish`).

## When to use

- The user wants to publish a package (any phrasing: "ship it", "release", "publish to npm", "cut 0.2.0").
- The user is about to run `npm publish` manually and would benefit from pre-flight checks.
- The user mentions a release-adjacent action that implies the full chain (e.g. "tag and release").

If only one stage is needed (e.g. "just bump the version"), still load this skill — the relevant section gives the right command. Don't refuse to engage just because the user only wants part of the workflow.

## The mental model

A release has four destinations, and each is a different kind of permanent:

| Destination | Permanence | Reversible? |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Local commit | trivial | yes (`git reset`) |
| Remote branch | visible to teammates/CI | hard (`push --force`, breaks others) |
| Git tag (pushed) | semi-permanent | hard (delete + re-push) |
| npm registry | **permanent** | **no** (version number is burned forever) |

So the order matters: do everything reversible first, verify hard, then publish last. If you publish first and then realize the README still says `npm i old-name`, the only fix is a new version.

## The workflow

Walk through these stages in order. Each stage has a "skip if" condition.

### Stage 0 — Establish state

Before touching anything, run these in parallel and read the output:

```bash
git status --short
git log --oneline -5
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
npm whoami           # confirms login; errors if not logged in
node --version
```

What you're checking:
- Working tree clean or has uncommitted changes? (drives Stage 1)
- Are we on `main` / `master`, or a branch? (releasing from a feature branch is usually wrong — flag it)
- Is the user logged in to npm? (no point continuing if not — direct them to `npm login --auth-type=web`)
- Does Node satisfy `engines.node` in `package.json`? (otherwise local builds may not match what users will get)

**Skip if:** never. Always do this.

### Stage 1 — Commit pending changes

If `git status` showed modifications, commit them before publishing. The reason: the npm tarball will contain the *current working tree* (after `prepublishOnly` builds), which means uncommitted source changes ship to users without ever being in git. That's how "the published version doesn't match any commit" bugs happen.

Show the user the diff (`git diff`) and propose a commit message based on what changed. Don't bundle unrelated changes into one release commit — if the user has half-finished work mixed with the release prep, ask them what should go in.

**Skip if:** working tree is clean.

### Stage 2 — Pre-publish sanity checks

These all run *before* the version bump because if any fail, you want to fix them on the current version, not a new one.

#### 2a. Lint `package.json`

```bash
npm pkg fix
git diff package.json
```

`npm pkg fix` silently auto-corrects things npm would otherwise warn about during publish. Common corrections:
- `bin.<name>` value `"./bin/foo"` → `"bin/foo"` (no leading `./`)
- `repository.url` `"https://..."` → `"git+https://..."`
- Removing trailing slashes, normalizing license SPDX, etc.

If `npm pkg fix` made changes, commit them now (small commit, e.g. `chore: normalize package.json`). Reason: you want the source-of-truth `package.json` to match what gets published. Otherwise every future `npm publish` re-emits the same warnings.

#### 2b. Build and smoke-test

```bash
npm run build         # if a build script exists
node <bin-path> --help
```

The smoke test catches the worst class of release bug: shipping a tarball whose binary doesn't actually run. The bin path is in `package.json` under `bin.<name>` — read it from there rather than guessing. If `--help` isn't supported, try `--version` or whatever the binary's no-op invocation is.

#### 2c. Dry-run pack

```bash
npm pack --dry-run 2>&1 | tail -50
```

This shows the exact file list that will end up in the tarball. **Read it carefully.** Things to flag:
- Is anything sensitive in there? `.env`, `.env.local`, private keys, internal docs?
- Is `node_modules` in there? (means `files` field is missing or wrong)
- Is the source TypeScript in there alongside the compiled JS? (usually unintended — bloats install size)
- Are the documented files all present? README, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, the bin, the dist?
- Total size sane? Most CLIs are <100 kB; if you're seeing 50 MB, something's wrong.

If any of these look off, fix `package.json` `files` (allowlist) or `.npmignore` (denylist) before continuing. Prefer `files` — it's safer because new files don't accidentally leak.

#### 2d. Name availability (only if first publish)

```bash
npm view <name>
```

A 404 means the name is free. A successful response means someone owns it — either you (in which case proceed) or someone else (in which case you need to scope or rename).

**npm also rejects names too similar to existing packages** at publish time, with no warning until you try. If `npm publish` later fails with "Package name too similar to existing packages X,Y; try renaming...", scope under an org or user:
- Update `name` in `package.json` to `@<scope>/<name>`
- **Sweep the install instructions** — README, landing pages, docs, any `npm install -g <oldname>` references. The scope changes the install command, and stale install commands are a major source of "it doesn't work" support tickets.
- Publish requires `--access=public` for scoped packages (see Stage 4).

**Skip if:** package has been published before (subsequent versions don't re-check the name).

### Stage 3 — Version bump

```bash
npm version <patch|minor|major>
```

This single command does three things: writes the new version into `package.json`, creates a commit, and creates an annotated git tag (e.g. `v0.2.0`). If the working tree wasn't clean it would refuse — that's why Stage 1 came first.

How to pick the bump (semver):
- **patch** — bug fixes, no behavior change for callers
- **minor** — new features, backwards-compatible
- **major** — breaking changes (remove a flag, rename a command, change exit codes)
- **0.x.y** — for pre-1.0 packages, the rules are loose; people commonly treat `0.x` minors as breaking. State your interpretation in the README so users know.

For pre-releases (e.g. release candidates), use `npm version prerelease --preid=rc` and publish with `--tag next` so it doesn't become the default install (Stage 4).

**Skip if:** the user is republishing a version they already own (rare — usually a re-publish after `npm unpublish`, which has a 72-hour window). In that case, no version bump.

### Stage 4 — Publish

```bash
npm publish                       # unscoped package
npm publish --access=public       # scoped package (@org/name) — defaults to private otherwise
npm publish --tag next            # pre-release, doesn't go to `latest`
```

If a `release` script exists in `package.json` (e.g. `"release": "npm publish --access=public"`), prefer that — the user has already encoded the right flags.

#### 2FA handling

If the account has 2FA on (it should), npm will reject the publish with E403 unless you provide an OTP. There are two ways:

**Option A — interactive prompt** (works in plain bash/zsh):
```bash
npm publish --access=public
# npm prompts: "This operation requires a one-time password. Enter OTP: ___"
```

**Option B — inline OTP** (required for shells that swallow the prompt — `ble.sh`, some terminal multiplexers, CI):
```bash
npm publish --access=public --otp=123456
```

OTPs rotate every ~30 seconds. If you suspect the user's shell will swallow the prompt (the previous attempt 403'd despite them being logged in), tell them to use Option B. Don't try to type the OTP for them — only the human can read their authenticator app.

#### When publish fails

Common errors and what they mean:
- **E403, "Two-factor authentication required"** — needs `--otp=`.
- **E403, "Package name too similar to existing packages X,Y"** — name collision; scope it (back to Stage 2d).
- **E403, "You cannot publish over the previously published versions"** — the version in `package.json` already exists on the registry. Bump again.
- **E402, "Payment Required"** — trying to publish a private scoped package without a paid plan; add `--access=public`.
- **E404, "Not Found"** — usually a registry config issue (`npm config get registry`); check it points at `https://registry.npmjs.org/`.

### Stage 5 — Push commits and tags

```bash
git push --follow-tags
```

`--follow-tags` pushes annotated tags reachable from the pushed commits — exactly what `npm version` creates. Don't use `git push --tags` (pushes *all* local tags, including unrelated experiments).

If the branch hasn't been pushed before, `git push -u origin <branch> --follow-tags`.

**Skip if:** the user explicitly says they want to publish without pushing (rare — usually a sign something's wrong). Flag it.

### Stage 6 — Verify

```bash
npm view <name>                    # confirms registry has the new version
npm view <name> versions --json    # lists all published versions
```

Optional but nice: `npx <name>@latest --version` from a different directory to confirm install actually works end-to-end.

## Sharp edges and gotchas

These are real things that have bitten real releases. Internalize them.

**Don't name a script `publish` in `package.json`.** It's a reserved lifecycle hook that runs *after* `npm publish`. If your `publish` script itself runs `npm publish`, you get infinite recursion. Use `release` instead.

**`npm version` refuses on a dirty tree.** This is a feature — it forces you to commit first so the tag is meaningful. Don't suppress with `--force` unless you understand why.

**Scoped packages default to private.** `@org/name` requires `--access=public` on first publish, or it errors with E402 (or silently goes to a paid private package on accounts that have one — even worse). Always pass it explicitly for scoped packages.

**`prepublishOnly` runs on `npm publish`, not on `npm pack`.** So a clean `npm pack --dry-run` doesn't prove the build works. You need an explicit `npm run build` before, or trust `prepublishOnly` to run during the real publish (it does).

**Version numbers are permanent.** `npm unpublish` exists but is restricted (72 hours after publish, only if no other package depends on it) and discouraged. Even after unpublish, you cannot republish the same version number. Plan the version bump like it's a database migration.

**The git tag is meaningless without a push.** Forgetting `git push --follow-tags` is the most common "release" bug — npm has the new version, GitHub doesn't have the tag, and now release notes/changelog automation is broken.

**Don't skip the dry-run pack to "save time".** It is the cheapest possible insurance against shipping a credentials file. Ten seconds of reading file names beats an hour of revoking tokens.

## Decision shortcuts

If the user has a `release` script and a clean tree and a published-before package and 2FA configured cleanly: just run it.

```bash
npm run release
```

If anything is non-default (first publish, dirty tree, scoped name change, no `release` script), walk the full workflow above. Don't skip stages just because the user is in a hurry — every stage exists because skipping it broke a real release.

## What the user sees

Communicate progress clearly. Before the publish, summarize what will happen:

> About to publish `@zeiq/locca@0.1.0`:
> - 33 files, 38.9 kB tarball
> - Smoke test passed
> - Will push to `main` with tag `v0.1.0`
>
> Confirm to proceed.

After the publish, confirm with `npm view` and report the install command:

> Published. Users can now install with:
> `npm install -g @zeiq/locca`

Don't be silent through the workflow — each stage's result is information the user wants. But don't over-narrate either; one line per stage is enough.
